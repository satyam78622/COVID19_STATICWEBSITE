    </div>



        <p class="jumbotron">
            Conaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).

            Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new strain that was discovered in 2019 and has not been previously identified in humans.<br />

            Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people.  Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans.</br>
        </p>
        <div class="alert alert-info">
            Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.</br>
        </div>
        <div class="alert alert-dark">
            Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.
        </div>
        <h2> Symptoms </h2>
        <div class="jumbotron">

            <p>
                Symptoms can range from mild illness to pneumonia. Some people will recover easily, and others may get very sick very quickly.
            </p>

            The following symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure:
            <ul>
                <li>fever</li>
                <li>flu-like symptoms such as coughing, sore throat and fatigue</li>
                <li>shortness of breath</li>
                <li>running nose</li>
            </ul>

                <li>There is currently <strong>no vaccine</strong> to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).</li>
                <li>The best way to prevent illness is to <strong>avoid being exposed</strong> to this virus.</li>
                <li>The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). </li>
                    <li>Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.</li>

                <h3>Clean your hands often</h3>
                <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least <strong>20</strong> seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</li>

                <li><strong>Avoid</strong> touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
                <hr />
                <h3>Avoid close contact</h3>
                <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick</li>
                <li>Put distance between yourself and other people if COVID-19 is spreading in your community. This is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="jumbotron">

                <h3>Stay home if you’re sick</h3>
                <li>Stay home if you are sick, except to get medical care. Learn what to do if you are sick.</li>

                <hr />
                <h3>Cover coughs and sneezes</h3>
                <li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow.</li>

                <hr />
                <h3>Wear a facemask if you are sick</h3>
                <li>If you are sick: You should wear a facemask when you are around other people (e.g., sharing a room or vehicle) and before you enter a healthcare provider’s office. If you are not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then you should do your best to cover your coughs and sneezes, and people who are caring for you should wear a facemask if they enter your room. Learn what to do if you are sick.</li>
                <li>If you are NOT sick: You do not need to wear a facemask unless you are caring for someone who is sick (and they are not able to wear a facemask). Facemasks may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers.</li>

                <li>
                    Stay home: People who are mildly ill with COVID-19 are able to isolate at home during their illness. You should restrict activities outside your home, except for getting medical care.
                </li>
                <li>Avoid public areas: Do not go to work, school, or public areas.</li>
                <li>Avoid public transportation: Avoid using public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis.</li>

            <hr />
            <h3>Separate yourself from other people and animals in your home</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Stay away from others: As much as possible, you should stay in a specific room and away from other people in your home. Also, you should use a separate bathroom, if available.</li>
                <li>Limit contact with pets & animals: You should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would around other people. Although there have not been reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19, it is still recommended that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus.</li>
                <li>When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a facemask.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr />
            <h3>Call ahead before visiting your doctor</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Call ahead: If you have a medical appointment, call the healthcare provider and tell them that you have or may have COVID-19. This will help the healthcare provider’s office take steps to keep other people from getting infected or exposed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Wear a facemask if you are sick</h3>

                <li>If you are caring for others: If the person who is sick is not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then people who live with the person who is sick should not stay in the same room with them, or they should wear a facemask if they enter a room with the person who is sick.</li>
